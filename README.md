============

This repository contains forks of a variety of (mostly suckless) tools that I've
hacked on to varying degrees as well as my personal config files and convenience
scripts.

My assumption is that the stuff in here isn't going to be of interest to anyone
but me, but if you've stumbled across this repo, and you see something you like,
feel free to do whatever you want with it.
